# journey-in-golang
This will serve as a repository for golang programs, and my journey in the language.
It contains go-to golang code snippets in form of examples along with comments to explain the code.
Major topics covered in the repository include
 - Hello world in Golang
 - Loops, Packages and Receivers
 - Working with files
 - Maps and Structs
 - Interfaces
 - HTTP Package and methods
 - Routines
 - Channels
 - Waitgroup implementation
 - Project in Go: Create a Cache in Golang
 - Notes and Cheatsheets

As I progress in the language and explore more, I'll keep adding more code snippets and examples
